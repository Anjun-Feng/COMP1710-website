    <h3>My Reflection about This Site </h3>
    <br><br>

    <p>
      It is a fun and challenging experience to build a website from scratch. I would like to give thanks to the tutors
      and the lecturer for their help and guidance. It's a great course and I have learned a lot from it. Before I take
      this course, I know very little or even nothing about web design. As the course digs deeper into the concept of
      web design, I realize that I am now familiar with the elements from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      <br><br>

      The first prototype of my website is very simple. It only contains a few pages and the design is very basic. I
      then chose to add more pages and make the website more interactive and dynamic using p5.js. After several
      iterations (which can be seen in the code repository), it looks much better than the first prototype. The thing
      I learnt from it is: never decide everything at the beginning. It is better to start with a simple design and
      then add more features to it. This is because it is hard to predict what the final product will look like. You may
      simply turn into not liking the current design, and it is way easier to change it if the design is simple.
      <br><br>

      There are many things that I would choose to do differently if I were to start again.
      First, the search bar is not working as expected. It is supposed to navigate to the page that matches the search,
      but it just won't work after many attempts. If I were to do it again, I would choose something else to implement
      with JavaScript.
      <br><br>

      Second, I was trying to implement a different color scheme. However, adjusting the colors is very time-consuming
      once you've decided the theme (in this case, a dark theme). It limits your imagination, for example, you won't
      be able to be creative by simply looking at a page in black. If I can have the chance to redo it, I would choose
      to simultaneously design the color scheme while I was implementing the dark theme.
      <br><br>

      In summary, there is no perfect website. There are always things that can be improved. I do hope that I will
      still maintain and improve my website in the future. And, the codebase of this website remains open-source.
      I hope students from the future can get help from my experience. I hope they can use, extend, or re-created the
      elements that it has to make their own website better.

  <h3>Native app development and Cross-platform app development</h3>
  <p>
    Native app development is developing apps using develop tools and programming languages
    that the platform supports. For example, Java / Kotlin for Android and Objective-C / Swift /
    iOS SDK for iOS. They have advantages of having full access to functionalities of the platform
    (GPS, camera, microphone) and high performance. However, it is a bit old. We need to dynamically
    release new content of our app. We want to reduce the cost and simplify team structures,
    so one team working on many platforms is much better than
    multiple teams working on different platforms.
    Therefore, the technology of cross-platform is becoming more and more popular.
    <br>
    There are many attempts of finding a good solution to solve such questions.
    For example, <code>HTML5 + native (Cordova, Ionic)</code>, <code>JS + native
    (React Native, Weex)</code> and <code>custom rendering + native (Qt mobile, Flutter)</code>.
    But aren't many of them succeeded as Flutter. E.g., Qt mobile fails to become a popular approach for
    poor mobile end support and community support.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>The advantages of Flutter</h3>
  <p>
    Ecology:<br> The Flutter ecosystem is growing rapidly, with an active community and a considerable number
    of developers and third-party components.<br><br>
    Technical support:<br> Google is currently promoting Flutter
    heavily, and many of its authors come from the Chromium team. The high activity on GitHub is another
    indication of strong support. From Flutter's inception to the present, the frequent release of new
    versions shows Google's significant investment in resources, so there is no need to worry about official
    technical support.<br><br>
    Development efficiency:<br> One codebase can run on multiple platforms, and Flutter's hot reload feature helps developers test, build UI, add functionality, and fix errors more quickly. It achieves millisecond-level hot reloading on iOS and Android simulators or physical devices without losing state. This is fantastic, and believe me, if you're a native developer, once you've experienced the Flutter development process, you may not want to go back to native development, as few people don't complain about the slow compilation speed of native development.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    First of all, let's take a look at the import statement.<br>
    <code class="inline_code">import 'package:flutter/material.dart';</code><br>
    Material is a visual design language that is widely used. Flutter provides
    us with various Material-styled UI components.<br><br>

    Just like Java, Kotlin, C/C++, a <code class="inline_code">main</code> function
    is an entrance of the app. In <code class="inline_code">main</code>, we can see
    it calls the method <code class="inline_code">runApp</code>, which starts a Flutter
    app. <code class="inline_code">runApp</code> takes in a <code class="inline_code">Widget</code> parameter, in this case, the <code class="inline_code">MyApp</code>
    object.
    <code class="inline_code">void main() => runApp(MyApp());</code><br>
    Notice the <code class="inline_code">=></code> here. It's a syntax sugar for writing
    a function in a single line.

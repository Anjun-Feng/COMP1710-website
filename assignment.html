<h1><b>2.0 Part 2 Tasks</b></h1>

<h2><b>2.1 Image Map</b></h2>
<p>Pls hover on the image to see what you can click on.</p>
<a href="./pages/addition/dart_subpgs/gallery_begin_darting.html">my image map</a><br>


<h2><b>2.2 Photo Gallery</b></h2>
<p>The gallery consists the programming language icons</p>
<a href="./pages/dart.html">my gallery</a><br>

<h2><b>2.3 Javascript addition</b></h2>
<p>First of all the background of all sites in my website is created using p5.js to give a dynamic, creative look.</p>
<p>Pls check the nav bar, where you can search interior sites. This functionality is achieved by Js.</p>
<a href="./index.html">search bar</a><br>

<p>Pls check the submit method. It prevents default behaviors of "submit" and wakes up system mailing client. This is achieved by Js as well.</p>
<a href="./pages/feedback.html">submit button of the form</a><br>

<h2><b>Well written Javascript</b></h2>
<p>The links below are for background effects:</p>
<a href="./p5js_impl/firebugs.js">firebugs</a><br>
<a href="./p5js_impl/galaxy.js">galaxy</a><br>
<a href="./p5js_impl/lanternNight.js">lanternNight</a><br>
<a href="./p5js_impl/shootingStars.js">shootingStars</a><br>
<a href="./p5js_impl/snowing.js">snowing</a><br>
<a href="./p5js_impl/visualizer.js">mic volume visualizer (Created but not applied yet)</a><br>

<p>The links below are for functionalities:</p>
<a href="./util/js/search.js">in-site search</a><br>
<a href="./util/js/submit.js">submit form</a><br>
<p>The urls search results are not functioning well due to css's url loading doesn't work well with Js
  But at least the results can still display just fine</p>


<h2><b>2.5 Student Forum Participation</b></h2>

<h1><b>3.0 Part 3 Tasks</b></h1>
<h2><b>3.1 Reflections</b></h2>
<a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7277205/pages/about_my_site.html">my reflection page</a>


<h2><b>3.2 Alternative CSS</b></h2>
<p>
  The alternative css is implemented with enabling and disabling an additional css file called "alternative.css". <br>
  It is applied to each page, by default overwritten by "default.css" to make sure in the first load it won't change<br>
  the style of the website.
  <br><br>

  To use it, you can click on the button in the footer called "Printer-friendly mode". If you press the button again,<br>
  it will change back to the default css style.
  <br><br>

  What happens is that, the page-breakers will now start to work, and the background effects will be "blocked"<br>
  temporarily by toggling p5.js's draw function to draw a pure black background at each framerate. The header (navbar)<br>
  and the footer will be temporarily hidden for printing as well. When one css file is being used, the other one will be blocked.<br>
  The control between two files is also implemented by javascript.
  <br><br>

  By testing, the font size and font color in the printer-friendly mode is already clear enough to see, so I didn't change them.

  <br><br>

<h2><b>3.3 Social Networking Button(s)</b></h2>
<p>Please refer to the social networking button in the footer</p>
<a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7277205/index.html">social networking button (in the footer)</a>


<h2><b>3.4 Social Networking Feed(s)</b></h2>
<p>I embed the Flutter's official twitter timeline so the audience can quickly browse relative information about
Dart and Flutter on my website. It fits well.</p>
<a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7277205/pages/social_feed.html">my social networking feed</a>


<h2><b>3.5 CSS and HTML Validation</b></h2>
<p>It has been tested that the validation for all my webpages gives no errors.</p>
<p>
  I've made sure that all warnings are such warnings as shown in the screenshots.
  Not removing these warnings helps maintain code readability and also gives supports to older browsers.
  <br><br>
  Feel free to test it yourself :)<br>

<h2><b>3.6 Something Original</b></h2>
<p>The js code below are not in the requirement for the purpose of this assignment, since they don't
  provide any functionalities. They were created by me to create a dynamic background</p>
